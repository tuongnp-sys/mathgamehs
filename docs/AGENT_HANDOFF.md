# Agent Handoff — HTML5 Portal Game (Emmind lessons)

**Paste this entire file into a new agent chat** together with [PORTAL_PLAYBOOK.md](./PORTAL_PLAYBOOK.md).  
Battle-tested from Emmind deployment through itch, GamePix resubmit, CrazyGames Basic, and Poki prep (as of June 2026).

For a shorter per-host checklist during packaging, see [PORTAL_QA.md](./PORTAL_QA.md).

---

## 1. Goal for a new agent

Build **portal-ready from week 1** — not “game done, then bolt on SDK.” One correct submit beats two reject cycles + ZIP rebuild + cover redo + 24h review wait.

**Proven ship order:**

```
itch (public) → GamePix (ZIP) → CrazyGames Basic (loose files) → Poki (when account provisioned)
```

---

## 2. Golden rules — day one

### Architecture

| Do | Why |
|----|-----|
| Vite `base: './'` | ZIP / iframe / subpath assets work |
| `platform/{poki,crazygames,gamepix,local}.js` + `?platform=` | Local test before upload |
| `VITE_PORTAL=1` for portal builds | Hide auth/header/footer; guest auto-login |
| One `npm run package:<portal>` per host | Never one ZIP for all portals |
| `localStorage` try/catch + host cloud save | Safari private / iframe no crash |

### Smooth gameplay + portal policy

| Rule | Violation |
|------|-----------|
| **No** music/SFX before user gesture | Autoplay policy fail |
| `gameLoaded` / `gameLoadingFinished` **before** interactive menu | GamePix/Poki auto-reject |
| **Ads only on restart** after game over/victory | Ad on first Start = reject |
| Portal pause → stop loop + audio + touch | QA requirement |
| **Separate portal viewport math** — not standalone desktop | GamePix 800×450 scroll = reject |

### Packaging (silent failures → blank game)

| Correct | Wrong |
|---------|-------|
| `index.html` at **ZIP root** | `dist/index.html` or `MyGame/index.html` wrapper |
| Windows: `tar -a -cf zip *` from `dist/` | `Compress-Archive` → backslashes → Linux extract breaks |
| CrazyGames: drag **loose files** from `dist/` | Upload ZIP → “Archive not supported” |

---

## 3. Each portal is different — do not copy-paste metadata

| | itch | GamePix | CrazyGames | Poki |
|---|------|---------|------------|------|
| Upload | ZIP | ZIP | **Loose files** | ZIP |
| Title | Free (`Emmind - 7 Layers of Ascent`) | **Must match namespace** (`Emmind 7 Layers`) | Form-specific | Form-specific |
| Iframe QA | 900×520 embed | **800×450, no page scroll** | Portal preview | Portal preview |
| SDK in HTML | None | **Static `<script gamepix.js>` in `<head>`** | Dynamic OK | Dynamic OK |
| Ads | None | `interstitialAd` after Game Over/Victory → restart | Midgame on restart | `commercialBreak` on restart |
| Cover | 630×500 | 1360×850 + icon 256×256 | 3 sizes + video ≤20s | Per form |
| In-game language | Flexible | **100% English** | English | English |

**GamePix title (Emmind):** namespace `emmind-7-layers` is fixed → dashboard, `<title>`, start-menu `<h2>`, cover, and icon must all say **`Emmind 7 Layers`**. itch keeps the long title; **do not** use the itch title on GamePix.

**Marketing subtitles** (“Center Your Heart”, “A meditative ascent…”) are taglines only — **never** replace the game title in `<h2>`.

---

## 4. Real Emmind obstacles and how to avoid them

### A. GamePix rejection (two rounds — same four items)

| # | QA issue | Root cause | Required fix |
|---|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | Does not fit **800×450** iframe | Desktop `maxH = Math.max(480, …)`; HUD/stats/controls not subtracted | `isPortalMode` in `syncGameViewport()`, `measurePortalEmbedChrome()`, `body.portal-mode { overflow: hidden }` |
| 2 | Title ≠ namespace | Dashboard `Emmind 7 Layers` vs in-game em dash / “Center Your Heart” | `vite.config.js` injects GamePix title; `syncGamePixTitle()`; one string everywhere |
| 3 | SDK integration not detected | SDK loaded only at runtime via `bootstrap.js` | Inject `<script src="...gamepix.js">` when `VITE_PORTAL_TARGET=gamepix` |
| 4 | “gamepix” visible during gameplay | Build stamp `emmind-portal · gamepix` | Skip stamp in portal mode; CSS hide `#game-build-stamp` |

**Lesson:** Full-browser preview **does not** represent GamePix QA. Always test **800×450** and run `npm run test:gamepix-embed`.

### B. ZIP / SDK Testing Toolkit

- A complete SDK ZIP **does not** guarantee a visible demo ad. The toolkit checks **hooks fire correctly**, not ad creatives.
- Ads trigger only: die or win → **Meditate Again**. First Start and Surrender **never** show ads — by design.
- Pass SDK Toolkit by uploading the ZIP there before expecting the dashboard SDK checkbox to validate.

### C. GamePix marketing assets

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Cover = flat dark blue + text only | Playwright `setContent` + `url('file://...')` does not load images | **Base64 data URI** embed PNGs in HTML |
| Cover shows old title “7 Layers of Ascent” | Reused itch cover with baked-in title | Gameplay collage + new title, or mask old title |
| Icon too dark, no gameplay | Sparse layer crop / heavy vignette | Live canvas capture (layer 1 or 3); higher brightness |

Script: `npm run build:gamepix-marketing` (run `npm run preview` first for live canvas capture).

### D. GamePix dashboard workflow

- **Save button greyed out** after Submit = form **locked** during “review within 24h” — normal, not a bug.
- Short description must be **100–500 characters**; Custom Session content must not contain `:` or `%`.
- Resubmit = upload new ZIP + icon + cover → **Submit for review**, not draft-only Save.

### E. YouTube / cross-portal branding

- One YouTube URL (`youtu.be/...`) is reused on itch, GamePix, and Poki.
- **No Replace video** on YouTube → old footage stays on the same URL; update **title + description + custom thumbnail** immediately.
- New footage = new Unlisted upload + update links on all portals **after** GamePix unlocks the form (post-review).
- Old itch trailer title does **not** block GamePix review if ZIP and in-game title are correct.

### F. Performance / smooth play

- Adaptive canvas DPR on mobile; avoid layout work every frame.
- Portal: subtract chrome before setting canvas height — prevents reflow and scroll.
- Audio: `AudioContext.resume()` on gesture; pause during ads and portal pause.
- No Google Fonts / analytics CDN in submission build — latency + policy risk.
- Run `npm run measure:dist` — CrazyGames < 50 MB; itch < 1000 files.

### G. CrazyGames and Poki (avoid repeat mistakes)

- CrazyGames Basic can reject vague metadata — desktop + mobile controls must be explicit; videos ≤ 20s.
- Poki account must be **provisioned by Poki** — self-signup often fails; keep `emmind-poki.zip` ready.

## 5. Pre-submit checklist (agent runs every time)

```bash
npm run package:<portal>
npm run measure:dist
npm run preview                    # separate terminal
# GamePix also:
npm run test:gamepix-embed
npm run build:gamepix-marketing    # before uploading icon/cover
```

**Manual verify:**

- [ ] Open ZIP → `index.html` at root; paths use `/` not `\`
- [ ] GamePix: `dist/index.html` contains `gamepix.js` in `<head>`
- [ ] In-game title = dashboard title (GamePix: `Emmind 7 Layers`)
- [ ] No visible “gamepix” / “poki” text during gameplay
- [ ] GamePix 800×450: playable, **no page scroll**
- [ ] First Start: **no** ad; after game over → restart: ad hook runs
- [ ] Console: no `GAMEPIX_LOADED_NOT_CALLED`
- [ ] 100% English in-game UI (GamePix)
- [ ] Icon/cover at exact pixel spec; title on assets matches

## 6. Emmind repo — where to read

| Task | Path |
|------|------|
| Full spec | `docs/PORTAL_PLAYBOOK.md` |
| Short checklist | `docs/PORTAL_QA.md` |
| GamePix copy-paste form | `packages/gamepix-submission.md` |
| SDK adapters | `platform/*.js` |
| Portal viewport, ads, title | `src/main.js` |
| GamePix SDK inject + build title | `vite.config.js` |
| ZIP packaging | `scripts/package-portal.mjs` |
| Automated embed QA | `scripts/test-gamepix-embed.mjs` |
| GamePix marketing assets | `scripts/build-gamepix-marketing.mjs` |

---

## 7. New agent must NOT

- Commit or push unless the user asks
- One build for all portals
- Use `Compress-Archive` on Windows for portal ZIPs
- Upload a ZIP to CrazyGames
- Hardcode all portal SDKs in `index.html` (exception: GamePix inject at build time only)
- Test only full-screen desktop
- Use the itch title on GamePix
- Generate marketing covers with `file://` URLs in Playwright
- Promise Poki self-service signup
- Panic because the SDK Toolkit shows no demo ad
- Edit the GamePix dashboard while status is “review within 24h”

---

## 8. One-line brief for a greenfield project

> Vite `base:'./'`, adapter per portal, portal mode in week 1, ads restart-only, audio after gesture, GamePix: static `gamepix.js` in ZIP + title matches namespace + fit 800×450 + English UI, Windows ZIP via `tar -a -cf`, CrazyGames = loose files, marketing PNGs via base64 in Playwright, test `?platform=` and exact iframe size before submit, itch first then GamePix, pre-write `packages/*-submission.md`.

---

## 9. GamePix ad timing (reference)

Ads call `GamePix.interstitialAd()` via `commercialBreak()` in `platform/gamepix.js`.  
In `src/main.js`, `shouldRunCommercialBreak()` returns true only when:

- `isPortalMode` is active
- `lastRunEndState` is `'gameover'` or `'victory'` (not `'surrender'`)
- User clicked restart (**Meditate Again**) → `beginNewRun()` → `runCommercialBreak()` before the new run

First **Start Meditation** never calls `commercialBreak()`.
