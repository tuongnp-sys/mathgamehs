## Audio assets

Place MP3 files under `public/assets/audio/` (see `public/assets/audio/README.md`).  
Game runs silently if files are missing; boot calls `gameLoaded` / `loadingFinished` before gameplay audio plays.

**Rule:** Always edit `public/assets/audio/`, never only `dist/` — rebuild copies from `public/`.

```bash
npm run build              # local / itch
